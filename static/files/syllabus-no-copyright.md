### Academic Honesty

Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the [Honor and Integrity System](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/) apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

**For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.**

The Codio platform can perform automatic plagiarism detection by comparing submitted projects against other students' submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.

### Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu), 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access Coordinator, at [jarowe@ksu.edu](mailto:jarowe@ksu.edu) or call 785-826-2971.

### Expectations for Conduct

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the [Student Judicial Conduct Code](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/) as outlined in the Student Governing Association [By Laws](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf), Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

### Mutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching & Learning Spaces

At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. K-State courses, labs, and other virtual and physical learning spaces promote equitable opportunity to learn, participate, contribute, and succeed, regardless of age, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, genetic information, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, military or veteran status, immigration status, Indigenous identity, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, religion, culture, as well as other social identities.

Faculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the (K-State Principles of Community)[https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/].

If you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors. If you have questions about how to proceed with a confidential process to resolve concerns, please contact the Student Ombudsperson Office. Violations of the [student code of conduct](https://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/student-code-of-conduct.html) can be reported [here](https://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/student-code-of-conduct.html). If you experience bias or discrimination, it can be reported [here](https://www.k-state.edu/report/discrimination/).

### Netiquette

<div class="notices info">
    <p>Info</p>
    <p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href="https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/">this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p>
</div>

Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the _context_ and _body language_ of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker _means_, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.

Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:

* **Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.** Subject lines such as "Question" or "Problem" are not helpful. Subjects such as "Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java" or "Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python" give plenty of information about your topic.
* **Use only one topic per message.** If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.
* **Be thorough, concise, and to the point.** Ideally, each message should be a page or less.
* **Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.** It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you've tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.
* **Consider carefully what you write before you post it.** Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.
* **If you are lost, don't know an answer, or don't understand something, speak up!** Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won't see that you asked a question. Don't be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.
* **Class discussions are confidential.** Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.
* **Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.** When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.
* **Do not use all caps.** It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.
* **No feigning surprise.** If someone asks a question, saying things like "I can't believe you don't know that!" are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.
* **No "well-actually's."** If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a "well, actually..." correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don't post a correction just for the sake of being correct.
* **Do not correct someone's grammar or spelling.** Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.
* **Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.** Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.
* **Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.** They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the [K-State Principles of Community](https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/).

### Face Coverings

All students are expected to comply with K-State’s face mask policy. As of August 2, 2021, everyone must wear face masks over their mouths and noses in all indoor spaces on university property, including while attending in-person classes. This policy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. For additional information and the latest on K-State’s face covering policy, see [this page](https://www.k-state.edu/covid-19/guidance/health/face-covering.html).

### Academic Freedom Statement

Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university's mission.

Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.

### Campus Safety

Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main page, [www.k-state.edu](http://www.k-state.edu), and click on the Emergency Information button, located at the bottom of the page.

### Student Resources

K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college, student life, health and safety, and others found at [www.k-state.edu/onestop](http://www.k-state.edu/onestop).

### Student Academic Creations

Student academic creations are subject to Kansas State University and Kansas Board of Regents Intellectual Property Policies. For courses in which students will be creating intellectual property, the K-State policy can be found at [University Handbook, Appendix R: Intellectual Property Policy and Institutional Procedures (part I.E.)](https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhxr.html). These policies address ownership and use of student academic creations.

### Mental Health

Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress, discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or emotional abuse. 

If you are struggling with these issues, do not wait to seek assistance.

### University Excused Absences

K-State has a [University Excused Absence policy (Section F62)](https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhsecf.html). Class absence(s) will be handled between the instructor and the student unless there are other university offices involved. For university excused absences, instructors shall provide the student the opportunity to make up missed assignments, activities, and/or attendance specific points that contribute to the course grade, unless they decide to excuse those missed assignments from the student’s course grade. Please see the policy for a complete list of university excused absences and how to obtain one. Students are encouraged to contact their instructor regarding their absences.
